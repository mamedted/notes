1.DOWNLOAD THIS FILE FROM THIS URL
https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.4/mkcert-v1.4.4-windows-amd64.exe

2.RENAME THE FILE INTO mkcert.exe and put it on, say dekstop

3.OPEN CMD, NAVIGATE TO DESKTOP FOLDER
cd desktop

4.RUN THE FOLLOWING
	
   mkcert -install
   mkcert 192.168.1.245 localhost 127.0.0.1

5.IT CREATES TWO FILES ON YOUR DEKSTOP
   192.168.1.245+2.pem
   192.168.1.245+2-key.pem

6.EDIT THE XAMPP/APACHE/CONF/EXTRA/httpd-ssl.conf

Mandatory: Search for server.crt, if any of it is not commented, add # in the first line.Because the browser loaded it when not commented.
Now, update the 

SSLCertificateFile "C:/Users/Lenovo_PC/Desktop/192.168.1.245+2.pem"
SSLCertificateKeyFile  "C:/Users/Lenovo_PC/Desktop/192.168.1.245+2-key.pem"

 7.RESTART APACHE

 8.IN CMD, run again
 CD desktop
 mkcert -install

 It will say something like "THE LOCAL CA IS NOW INSTALLED IN THE SYSTEM TRUST STORE.
 it will create automatically a file name mkcert-root.pem or root.pem

 Copy this file (not the key) into your phone and install it as CA. AND BOOM! IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC
